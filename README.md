# Tuning-an-LLM-with-RLHF

## Overview
This project focuses on tuning a Large Language Model (LLM) using Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback (RLHF). RLHF is employed to improve the performance of the foundational model by fine-tuning it based on human preferences and specific task instructions. The project integrates Google Cloud services, KubeFlow Pipelines, and Vertex AI to facilitate the training and evaluation processes.
